# Code Structure

## Controllers

- Handles HTTP requests and sends responses.

## Services

- Contains business logic and interacts with models.

## Models

- Mongoose models to interact with MongoDB.

## Routes

- Maps incoming HTTP requests to controller methods.

## Future Considerations

- I might refactor the structure as I learn more about industry standards. For now, Iâ€™m experimenting with separating concerns.
