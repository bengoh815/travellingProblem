# main idea

### Todo
top priority
- [ ] check if userNums and userLocs are aligned
- [ ] implement aliasTable to handle new alias that might exist
- [ ] probably could have a better structure of db.py
- [ ] modify aliastable to be more general use
- [ ] implement db.py delUser()
- [ ] improve foreign key relations between alias and users
lowest priority

### In progress
- [ ] start working on UI
    - want to display on a website thing
        [X] research how to do so
    - latitude (the y axis) and longitude (the x axis)
    - setting up a new backend system for the project

### Done
- [X] check if everything is working
    - I have backup data stored
    - compile a list of data to be tested
    - seems to be working
- [X] figure out db schema structure
